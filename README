What is this?
-------------

Niepce Digital is a digital photography software.

It is currently work in progress.

To build you need the following:
--------------------------------

- A C++17 compiler
- A Rust compiler
- cairo 1.1
- glibmm 2.66
- gtkmm 4.4
- giomm
- cairomm
- shumate 1.0.0
- libadwaita >= 1.2.0
- libxml2 > 2.5.0
- boost 1.60
- exempi >= 2.6.0
- libopenraw >= 0.3.0
- gegl >= 0.4.0
- babl
- libgphoto2
- gexiv2 >= 0.10 (as required by rexiv2)
- meson >= 0.59 (for the meson buildsystem)

Niepce is being developed on Linux. It should build and work on other
UNIX systems.

There are two build systems.

### Autotools build

The original build system use autotools. It will be deprecated at one point.

To build from git, you will need `autoconf-archive` and `gettext` (development
files), the latter being for `autopoint`.

### Meson build

The meson build is new and can be used in parallel.

To build with the address sanitizer, pass `-Db_sanitize=address` to
meson (it's standard).

### Building as a flatpak

If you want to build using flatpak-builder, use the manifest in
`flatpak/org.gnome.Niepce.json`. The following will build and install
it in the user installation of flatpak. It requires the GNOME SDK to
be installed.

```shell
$ cd flatpak
$ flatpak-builder --force-clean --ccache  --install --user build-dir org.gnome.Niepce.json
```

Getting the code
----------------

Obviously you have it.

The most recent code is hosted on GNOME's gitlab server. See:
