What is this?
-------------

Niepce Digital is a digital photography software.

It is currently work in progress.

To build you need the following:
--------------------------------

- A C++17 compiler
- A Rust compiler
- cairo 1.1
- glibmm 2.66
- gtkmm 4.4
- giomm
- cairomm
- shumate 1.0.0
- libadwaita >= 1.2.0
- libxml2 > 2.5.0
- boost 1.60
- exempi >= 2.6.0
- libopenraw >= 0.3.0
- gegl >= 0.4.0
- babl
- libgphoto2
- gexiv2 >= 0.10 (as required by rexiv2)
- meson >= 0.59

For the RawTherapee engine:

- expat
- fftw3f
- libiptcdata
- lensfun > 0.3
- lcms2

Niepce is being developed on Linux. It should build and work on other
UNIX systems.

### Meson

The build system uses meson. It will wrap cargo for the Rust code.

Make sure to get the git submodules. `git submodule update --init`
should do it.

To build with the address sanitizer, pass `-Db_sanitize=address` to
meson (it's standard).

### Building as a flatpak

If you want to build using flatpak-builder, use the manifest in
`flatpak/org.gnome.Niepce.json`. The following will build and install
it in the user installation of flatpak. It requires the GNOME SDK to
be installed.

```shell
$ cd flatpak
$ flatpak-builder --force-clean --ccache  --install --user build-dir org.gnome.Niepce.json
```

Getting the code
----------------

Obviously you have it.

The most recent code is hosted on GNOME's gitlab server. See:
