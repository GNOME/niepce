INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the style guide for the Niepce project.


INDENTATION
-----------

There is a .clang-format that will do the formatting for you.

Spaces, not tab.
4 spaces.

Curly braces are mandatory.

Opening brace on the same line as the statement
-except for functions, classes

Inner block, always indented
-except namespaces


SYMBOLS
-------

Namespaces:
-Lower case, short

Classes:
-Camel case, starting with an uppercase

Methods:
-snake lowercase

Variables
-lowercase
Member variables are prefix with m_ to alleviate shadowing

Constants
-uppercase


HEADERS
-------

Use #pragma once for header guards.


C++
---

The standard is C++11.

Use of 'override' is mandatory. Anywhere it is missing is a bug.
Use auto when possible.

Avoid raw pointers. Use unique_ptr<> or shared_ptr<>. You can typedef
the pointer type by suffixing Ptr to the class name.
