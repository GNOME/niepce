Previewer design doc
====================


The previewer is backed by a cache with file system based store for
the images.

Previews include both thumbnails and rendered (processed) images.

The cache
---------

The cache: a sqlite database with the following columns in the `cache_items` table.

`id`: unique ID of the entry.
`path`: the source path.
`dimension`: the max dimentsion. XXX how does this work for different crops?
`last_access`: last recently used. Each time the preview is pulled from cache this is updated
`created`: date of last generation.
`render`: a UNIQUE digest of the render parameters.
`target`: a generated file name

```sql
CREATE TABLE cache_items (\
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\
       path TEXT NOT NULL,\
       last_access INTEGER,\
       created INTEGER,\
       dimension INTEGER,\
       render TEXT NOT NULL,\
       target TEXT NOT NULL,\
       UNIQUE (path, dimension, render));\
```

The file backend
----------------

In a fixed location the file are stored, split into subdirs based on the
name.

Render params
-------------

R(): the rendering function
f: the source image file
params: the rendering params
P: the resulting preview

R(f, params) -> P

In short the rendering of a file with params always lead to the same
result.

Note: params always include the dimensions of the output.

Logic
-----

# Getting a preview from the cache

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Query image] --> B{In database?}
    B -- Yes -->  G[Update LRU]
    G --> C[Fetch file]
    B -- No --> E[Render image]
    E --> E2{Success?}
    E2 -- Yes --> F[Store image in DB]
    E2 -- No --> D2[Return Error]
    C --> D[Return Content]
    F --> C
```

An image is in a database if `path`, `dimension` and `render` do
match.

# Cache cleanup

Define an age threshold.

Query all the cache items that have LRU older than threshold.
Delete the corresponding files.

Rendering
---------

Rendering is the action of processing a file to generate full size
previews. There is a large benefit to cache them because processing
takes longer than just a pre-rendered.

The `ThumbnailCache` should act as a front to the renderer. The
darkroom module will request the Thumbnail cache for a render, and the
thumbnail cache will call the renderer if needed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Query Render] --> B{In cache?}
    B -- Yes -->  C[Fetch file]
    C --> G[Send notification `ImageRendered`]
    B -- No --> E[Render image]
    E --> E2{Success?}
    E2 -- Yes --> D[Save file in cache]
    D --> G
```

To request the rendering, the `ThumbnailCache` will call
`get_preview`. If it can't find the file, it will request the bitmap
from the processor using a callback so that it can send it to the
libnotifications and save it in the cache.
